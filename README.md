### Job Outlines

#### Marketing
Every event must sell. Marketing helps with that. Part of your job, promotion on social media, will also be handled by all members and volunteers. Your remaining tasks are to:
*	Think of creative ways of marketing the symposium and the FIFA Tournament
*	Think of creative ideas for promotional posters
*	Make simple posters for printing or social media (if you’re experienced with graphic design or poster design)
*	Use social media accounts for the club for updates (we’ll provide the handles)


#### Media
An event, even the best one, is worthless if there’s nothing to remember it by. We’re counting on you for recording the event. You will be responsible for:
*	Photographing the symposium, its events, and participants
*	Shooting video clips from the event, from a few seconds, to a few minutes
*	Clicking snazzy and embarrassing pictures of Turists for Roast Day

#### Sponsorship and Lobbying
We realize this post might sound obscure. That’s because it is. We’re relying on your persuasion and flair for words to help with the event. You’ll be responsible for:
*	Convincing students to take part in the FIFA tournament (you won’t be alone in this)
*	Speaking to any sponsors on the phone
*	Speaking to representatives from other schools
*	A short background info speech about the club during Opening Ceremony
*	Possibly negotiating with shops who make/print our merchandise and posters
*	Convincing guest speakers and judges for the pitching event

#### Event Day
This post was the most competitive one. You’re here because we believe you can make the event successful (or at least prevent it from being a disastrous failure :) You’ll be responsible for:
*	Handling any crises during the events or Opening/Closing Ceremony
*	Handling décor, posters, standees, etc.
*	Guiding participants to locations for the event
*	Communicating any problems to the Turists
*	Looking after registration of schools on the first day
*	Enforcing discipline (although that’s trivial)


#### Logistics
Logistics are the heart of this event. They embody the phrase ‘planning is preparation’. As the logistics head, you’ll be responsible for the following tasks:
*	Accounting of all costs incurred during planning
*	Helping plan food, accommodation, transportation. Note that you don’t actually have to plan it yourself, you only have to help
*	Handling printing of merchandise, t-shirts, posters, etc. (look for the cheapest places)
*	Thinking of potential sponsors, guest speakers, and pitching judges

#### Quiz Team
This role ties less with volunteering and more with the event itself. You’ll be responsible for handling the quizzing event of GOC’17. If you prove yourself to be worthy, you might have a chance at being a Turist. Your responsibilities are:
*	Planning the quizzing format
*	Looking for quiz questions
*	Varying types of quiz questions (will be debriefed on this later)
*	Making sure quiz questions remain secret


As a final note: More than failure, IB teaches us the importance of interdisciplinary work. All volunteers can contribute to other roles, if they feel they have ideas or a hold of the job required. Event Day Heads can help with logistics, Marketing Heads can help with lobbying, etc. We’re not bounding you just to your specific post. All volunteers will also be required to share Facebook posts of the club, such as those announcing the FIFA Tournament. All the responsibilities above are an outline of your role. We will be delegating more tasks as per the need. And finally, make sure to have fun before/during the event!
